# Live Weather & Earthquakes 

This project hosts two Leaflet web maps on GitHub Pages:

- *Weather Map* — Live NEXRAD radar (Iowa State Mesonet WMS) and active NWS alerts (styled by severity).
- *Earthquake Map* — Recent USGS earthquakes with popups, magnitude-based styling, and a legend.
- *Combined Map* — Bonus: Toggle between weather alerts and earthquake data.
